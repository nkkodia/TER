	 "abstract" : "It is not uncommon that individuals create multiple profiles across several SNSs, eachcontaining partially overlapping sets of personal information. As a result, the creation of aglobal profile that gives an holistic view of the information of an individual requires methodsthat automatically match, or reconciliates, profiles across SNSs.
