"abstract": "Structured learning approaches are able to take into account the relationalstructure of data, thus promising an enhancement over non-relationalapproaches. In this paper we explore two document-related tasks in relationaldomains setting, the annotation of semi-structured documents and the citationdeduplication. For both tasks, we report results of comparing relational learningapproach namely Markov logic, to non-relational one namely Support VectorMachines (SVM). We discover that increased complexity due to the relationalsetting is difficult to manage in large scale cases, where non-relational modelsmight perform better. Moreover, our experiments show that in Markov logic,the contribution of its probabilistic component decreases in large scale domains,and it tends to act like First-order logic (FOL).",
