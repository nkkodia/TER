"abstract": "Interestingness measures play an important role in data mining regardless of the kind of patterns being mined. These measures are intended for selecting and ranking patterns according to their potential interest to the user. Good measures also allow the time and space cost of the mining process to be reduced. Measuring the interestingness of discovered patterns is an active and important area of data mining research. Although much work has been conducted in this area, so far there is no widespread agreement on a formal definition of interestingness in this context. Based on the diversity of definitions presented to date, interestingness is perhaps best treated as a broad concept, which emphasizes conciseness, coverage, reliability, peculiarity, diversity, novelty, surprisingness, utility, and actionability. This presentation reviews interestingness measures for rules and summaries, classifies them from several perspectives, compares their properties, identifies their roles in the data mining process, gives strategies for selecting appropriate measures for applications, and identifies opportunities for future research in this area.",
