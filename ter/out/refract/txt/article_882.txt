Data freshness has been identified as one of the most important dataquality attributes in information systems. This importance increases especially inthe context of systems that integrate a large set of autonomous data sources. In thispaper we describe a quality evaluation framework which allows evaluation of datafreshness in different architectural contexts. We also show how this quality factormay impact the reconfiguration of a data integration system to fulfill userexpectations.
