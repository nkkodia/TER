Semantic relations are the core of a growing number of knowledge-intensive systems. Theneed to validate automatically such relations remains an up-to-date challenge. In this paper, wepresent a web-based method enabling the automatic identification of the class of a semantic relation.Using measures based on syntactic patterns as entry features for a learning algorithm,we are able to successfully identify 72% of semantic relations divided in 4 classes in a semanticallyrich environment.
