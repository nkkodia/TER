"abstract": "Artificial Intelligence has long had the dream of making computers smarter. For quite sometime, this vision has remained just that: a dream. With the development of large knowledgebases, though, we now have large amounts of semantic information at our hands. This changesthe game of AI. Computers have indeed become smarter. In this talk, we present the latestdevelopments in the field: The construction of general purpose knowledge bases (includingYAGO and DBpedia, as well as NELL and TextRunner), and their applications to tasks thatwere previously out of scope, The extraction of fine-grained information from natural languagetexts, semantic query answering, and the interpretation of newspaper texts at large scale.",
