	 "title" : "A Contextualization Service for a Personalized Access Model",
	 "abstract" : "Personalization paradigm aims at providing users with the most rel-evant content and services according to many factors such as interest center orlocation at the querying time. All this knowledge and requirements are orga-nized into user profiles and contexts. A user profile encompasses metadata de-scribing the user whereas a context groups information about the environmentof interaction between the user and the system. An interesting problem is there-fore to identify which part of the profile is significant in a given context. Thispaper proposes a contextualization service which allows defining relationshipsbetween user preferences and contexts. Further, we propose an approach forthe automatic discovery of these mappings by analyzing user behavior extractedfrom log files.",
