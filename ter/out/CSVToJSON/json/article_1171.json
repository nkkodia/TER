"title": "TOM: A library for topic modeling and browsing",
"abstract": "In this paper, we present TOM (TOpic Modeling), a Python libraryfor topic modeling and browsing. Its objective is to allow for an efficient analysisof a text corpus from start to finish, via the discovery of latent topics. To thisend, TOM features advanced functions for preparing and vectorizing a text corpus.It also offers a unified interface for two topic models (namely LDA usingeither variational inference or Gibbs sampling, and NMF using alternating leastsquarewith a projected gradient method), and implements three state-of-the-artmethods for estimating the optimal number of topics to model a corpus. What ismore, TOM constructs an interactive Web-based browser that makes exploringa topic model and the related corpus easy.",
