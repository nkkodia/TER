Tweets are short messages that do not exceed 140 characters. Since they must be written respecting this limitation, a particular vocabulary is used. To make them understandable to a reader, it is therefore necessary to know their context. In this paper, we describe our approach for the tweet contextualization. This approach allows the extension of the tweet's vocabulary by a set of thematically related words using mining association rules between terms.
