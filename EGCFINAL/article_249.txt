Regularized generalized canonical correlation analysis (RGCCA) is a generalization of regularizedcanonical correlation analysis to three or more sets of variables. It constitutes a generalframework for many multi-block data analysis methods. It combines the power of multi-blockdata analysis methods (maximization of well identified criteria) and the flexibility of PLS pathmodeling (the researcher decides which blocks are connected and which are not). Searchingfor a fixed point of the stationary equations related to RGCCA, a new monotone convergentalgorithm, very similar to the PLS algorithm proposed by Herman Wold, is obtained. Finally,a practical example is discussed.
