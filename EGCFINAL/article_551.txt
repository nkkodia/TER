There is little doubt that data mining technologies create new challenges in the area of dataprivacy. In this talk, we will review some of the new developments in Privacy-preserving DataMining. In particular, we will discuss techniques in which data mining results can reveal per-sonal data, and how this can be prevented. We will look at the practically interesting situationswhere data to be mined is distributed among several parties. We will mention new applica-tions in which mining spatio-temporal data can lead to identification of personal information.We will argue that methods that effectively protect personal data, while at the same time pre-serve the quality of the data from the data analysis perspective, are some of the principal newchallenges before the field.
