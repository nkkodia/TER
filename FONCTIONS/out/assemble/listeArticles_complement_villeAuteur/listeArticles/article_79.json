	 "abstract" : "Big Data is used to refer to the very large datasets generated by scientists, to the manypetabytes of data held by companies like Facebook and Google, and to analyzing real-time dataassets like the stream of twitter messages emerging from events around the world. Key areasof interest include technologies to manage much larger datasets (cf. NoSQL), technologies for the visualization and analysis of databases, cloud-based data management and dataminingalgorithms.Recently, however, we have begun to see the emergence of another, and equally compellingdata challenge - that of the Broad data that emerges from millions and millions of rawdatasets available on the World Wide Web. For broad data the new challenges that emerge includeWeb-scale data search and discovery, rapid and potentially ad hoc integration of datasets,visualization and analysis of only-partially modeled datasets, and issues relating to the policiesfor data use, reuse and combination. In this talk, we present the broad data challenge anddiscuss potential starting points for solutions. We illustrate these approaches using data froma meta-catalog of over 1,000,000 open datasets that have been collected from about twohundred governments from around the world.",
