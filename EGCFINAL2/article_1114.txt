Machine learning has proven to be a powerful tool in diverse fields, and is getting moreand more widely used by non-experts. One of the foremost difficulties they encounter liesin the choice and calibration of the machine learning algorithm to use. Our objective is thusto provide assistance in the matter, using a meta-learning approach based on an evolutionaryheuristic. We introduce here this approach as a potential solution to the limitation of currentdata characterization.
