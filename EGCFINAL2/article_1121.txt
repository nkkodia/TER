In this paper, we propose two contributions about the determination of chromatic numberand the verification of the 2-colorability property. We introduce an unreleased relation betweenthe problem of hypergraph coloring and the computation of minimal transversals hypergraphand, especially, a subset of them. Thereby, we propose two algorithms in order to optimize theverification of the 2-colorability property of hypergraphs and the evaluation of the chromaticnumber. Experiments carried out on several types of hypergraphs, showed that our algorithmobtains very interesting results.
