Predicting the price of the electricity commodity in the long term is a challenge that currenttechniques do not meet satisfactorily (Karakatsani et Bunn, 2010; Weron, 2014). In this paper,we introduce a new regression tree based model that yields good predictions on a long-termperiod with low computational resources requirements. Our approach is validated by temporalseries collected from an electricity provider.
